# BpresenT
A framework for the discovery and verification of ACPA-specific BCR-derived neoepitopes as candidates for therapeutic vaccination in Rheumatoid Arthritis.


## Abstract

The BpresenT framework consists of multiple flexible python modules encapsulated in a Django project. It incorporates two publicly available tools: The IMGT V-Quest tool for B- and T-cell receptor sequence analysis and alignment, and the NetMHCpan4.1 tool for HLA Class I-peptide presentation predictions.  

The integration of these tools and modules into BpresenT makes for a more coherent approach to combining V-Quest results and NetMHCpan interaction, allowing for the ability to locate and analyze potential HLA class I presenting peptides. This information is enhanced by the custom analytics modules, providing information such as sequence isotype identification and sequence gene and allele usage grouped by patient. The framework’s abstraction modules allow for the management of all data saved in the framework’s database including functions like filtering and exporting.  

On top of the BpresenT framework, the BpresenT Graphical User Interface (GUI) is built. The GUI applies the framework’s modules in a streamlined fashion, accessible to those without any programming knowledge. It provides an overview of the data supplied by the user and the accompanying data generated by NetMHCpan, and the framework’s modules. By progressing through the GUI, B-cell receptors with promising in-silico peptide predictions can be selected for in-vitro testing. The mass-spectrometry results from in-vitro testing can be imported and compared to the in-silico results for validation. The GUI makes use of the 'html compiler' framework module to visualize an overview of a given sequence’s predicted peptides, found peptides, nucleotide mutations, amino-acid changes, glycosylation sites and V-Quest determined germlines through an interactive sequence alignment viewer.
